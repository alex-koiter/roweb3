Mentoring is at the heart of what makes rOpenSci a community. 
Our members mentoring each other at different moments: 
when someone new joins and needs help navigating the community; 
when a member steps into a new role or project and could use some guidance; 
during everyday interactions, where people share tips and advice with each other; 
or when a more experienced member helps others grow into leadership roles. 
Each of these moments is a chance to share what you know, build connections, and keep the community strong.

Since 2022 we have our Champions Program that have a formal role of mentoring. 
To help our Champions Program mentors do their best work, we've put together a set of resources: a training, a handbook, and a monthly charter. 
 In this post, we'll walk you through what we've created and show how these resources can support your mentoring easier â€”whether you're part of rOpenSci or mentoring in another context.

## Mentor handbook/guidelines

## Monthly charter

## Summary

These tools are designed with rOpenSci Champions Program mentors in mind, but we hope they're also useful for anyone in a mentoring role. 
We would love to hear if you know of other useful resources for mentors.
