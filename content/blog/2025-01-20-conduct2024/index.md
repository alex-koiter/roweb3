rOpenSciâ€™s activities and spaces are supporter by a Code of Conduct 
that applies to all people participating in the rOpenSci community, 
including rOpenSci staff and leadership.
It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, 
the rOpenSci discussion forum, Slack, Community Calls, Co-working and social sessions, 
in person at rOpenSci-hosted events, including social gatherings affiliated with the event.
It is developed and enforced by a committee including rOpenSci staff and an independent community member.

reporting process, and internal guidelines for handling reports and enforcement.
